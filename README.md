# EasyOpenData

## Open Data Extractor for German Spatial Datasets

### Overview

EasyOpenData is a platform that provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing and downloading spatial data from German open data sources, covering all Bundesl√§nder. It standardizes the diverse formats in which these datasets are available and presents them to users via an intuitive web interface.

Users can interact with a map, select areas of interest (via polygons), and choose the data layers they wish to download. Available data types include:

- **3D Buildings (LOD1/LOD2)**

The platform processes the selected data and provides it in the user's desired format after payment, either as a direct download or via email.

### Key Features

- **Map-Based User Interface**: Allows users to interact with spatial data visually by selecting areas on a map.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Data is standardized into a unified format, enabling seamless querying and export.
- **Dynamic Data Processing**: Fetches and processes data only for the area selected by the user, ensuring efficiency.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Users can preview data layers on the map as they select their areas of interest.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing via Stripe.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built for performance, capable of handling large datasets from multiple regions.

### Technologies Used

#### Backend

- **PostGIS**: Spatial database for storing and querying geographic data efficiently.
- **Python FastAPI**: Backend framework for building APIs to handle user requests and interact with PostGIS.
- **GDAL**: Used for data conversion between formats.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for portability and scalability.
- **Stripe API**: For handling payment transactions.

#### Frontend

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MapLibre GL JS**: Interactive map interface for visualization and area selection.
- **Deck.gl**: For rendering 3D data on the map.
- **Mapbox Draw**: Allows users to draw shapes on the map.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** (for frontend development).
- **Python 3.10+** (for backend development).

#### Setup Instructions

##### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/easyopendata.git
cd easyopendata
```

##### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories if needed to set environment variables.

##### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

- Start the PostGIS database.
- Build and run the backend FastAPI server.
- Build and run the frontend React application.

##### Access the Application

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:5400](http://localhost:5400)
