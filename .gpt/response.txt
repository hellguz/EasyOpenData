# EasyOpenData Frontend

## Overview

This is a simple frontend HTML page that displays 2D buildings of NÃ¼rnberg using Leaflet. It fetches building data from the backend and renders them on an interactive map.

## Setup

1. **Serve the Frontend**

   Use Python's HTTP server to serve the frontend files.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python -m http.server 8080
